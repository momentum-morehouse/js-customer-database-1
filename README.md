# Make a customer database

## Directions

In this homework, you will build a customer database using DOM manipulation with JavaScript. You will get the customer data via `customers.js`, an included JavaScript module, and format dates via a third-party library, [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/). You can also use other third-party libraries if you wish.

The customers were generated using [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/), and so they contain a lot of data. For our purposes, you will need their name, address, phone numbers, thumbnail, birthdate, and the date they became a customer, which is stored as `registered` in the data.

### Step 1

Render all the data and the image for one customer only.

### Step 2
Once you have rendered one customer, apply the code and render each customer and their data.


## Layout

Your site should look like the following screenshot. You can be creative with design. This is a suggestion. You need to display all the data and the images, but you may take creative license with the design.
